Ques 6 - What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

SOl -IDs and classes are attributes used to identify and style HTML elements. 
     They are primarily used in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to apply 
     styles or manipulate elements.
      
    --> The ID attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element.
      1)Unique – Each element must have a unique ID in a document.
      2)Used for JavaScript Targeting – IDs are commonly used in JavaScript for element selection.
      3)CSS Selector – Prefixed with # in CSS.

    EX-  <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <style>
                #main-title {
                    color: blue;
                    font-size: 24px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>
        </body>
        </html>


    --> The class attribute is used to group multiple elements that share the same styling or behavior.
        1)Reusable – Multiple elements can share the same class.
        2)CSS Selector – Prefixed with . (dot) in CSS.
        3)Can Be Applied to Multiple Elements – Unlike IDs, classes are not unique.

        EX- <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <style>
                .highlight {
                    background-color: yellow;
                    font-weight: bold;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p class="highlight">This is an important paragraph.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Another highlighted paragraph.</p>
        </body>
        </html>
