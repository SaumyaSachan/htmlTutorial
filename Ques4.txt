 Ques - What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.
 
 Sol - Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that carry meaningful names
        and describe their content clearly. These elements help both browsers and developers 
        understand the structure and purpose of the content. Semantic HTML improves readability,
        accessibility, and SEO.
